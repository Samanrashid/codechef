The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of women.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,AN, the ages of the women.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the number of women eligible for self-defence training.
